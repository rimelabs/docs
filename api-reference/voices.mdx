title: Finding a Voice
---

Rime's TTS functionality exposes both a large set of demographically diverse set of voices to users as well as an increasingly large toolkit for generating voices on the fly.

## Demographic categories

Rime currently has many voices across a number of demographic categories (including Southern, African American, Latina, Midwestern, and LGBT voices) as well as age ranges from young to old.

## Finding a voice

Your [Dashboard](https://rime.ai/dashboard) is a great place to find a voice. By specifying filters, you can find Rime voices that meet your needs.

Using these filters, and using the play button to hear the voices, you've determined `Colby` will be a great voice for your application. You can then use `Colby` as the `speaker` parameter for Rime's TTS API.
