Keeping track of system metrics is crucial for maintaining a stable Rime self-hosted deployment. These insights help guide decisions about scaling and performance. To support this, Rime services expose multiple endpoints that let you monitor system health.

### Rime API

A `/health` route is available on port 8000 to give you a quick snapshot of overall status. You can check it with the following command:

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/health"
```

A typical response looks like this:
```json
{
  "apiStatus": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2025-04-03T13:59:58.902Z",
  "licenseStatus": "valid",
  "modelReachable": true
}
```
This provides a simple health check mechanism to verify that both api and model services are up and responding.

### Rime Model
To check if the model is running properly, you can perform a liveness probe using the `/ping` endpoint:

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/ping"
```

A typical response looks like this:
```json
pong
```

### Prometheus Metrics
⚠️ More metrics to be added in future releases.

For more detailed operational insights, the model service exposes Prometheus-compatible metrics at the /metrics endpoint:

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/metrics"
```

This endpoint provides telemetry data including:
* HTTP Request Counters: Detailed breakdown of requests by endpoint, status code, and HTTP method
* Error Tracking: Counts of HTTP errors by type and status code

Example metrics include:
```json
# HELP http_requests_total Total number of HTTP requests
# TYPE http_requests_total counter
http_requests_total{endpoint="/invocations",http_status="200",method="POST"} 102018.0
http_requests_total{endpoint="/metrics",http_status="200",method="GET"} 69908.0
http_requests_total{endpoint="/invocations",http_status="500",method="POST"} 38.0

# HELP http_errors_total Total number of HTTP errors
# TYPE http_errors_total counter
http_errors_total{endpoint="/invocations",error_message="cannot access local variable '_var_var_6' where it is not associated with a value",http_status="500",method="POST"} 38.0
```

These metrics can be integrated with Prometheus monitoring systems to create dashboards and alerts for your Rime deployment. Read integration setup in the next page.
