Custom Pauses and Pronunciations



Rime's TTS is unique among next-gen TTS offerings in allowing users to customize their output. Out-of-the-box, Rime's voices will speak fluently and correctly, but since strings of words can be pronounced differents for special effect, we allow users to add custom pauses and custom pronunciations. Let's see how.


## Custom Pauses

To insert a pause within a sentence, simply inset the length of your desired pause in milliseconds inside angle brackets, for example: `<1500>`.

To hear the difference, compare the following:

input:    `"text": "wait <1000> you're an alien?",`


input:    `"text": "wait you're an alien?",`


## Custom Pronunciation

We can add words to our dictionary with in about 24 hours, but if you want to stipulate a pronunciation yourself, you can input a specific pronunciation within curly brackets. 

For example the word `custom` would be represented as `{k1Ast0xm}`.

This works for even made-up words, like `glorbulets` as {gl1orby0ul2Ets}

Below is a guide to the phonetic alphabet we use
