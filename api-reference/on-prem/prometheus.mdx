title: Prometheus Integration
---
Prometheus is an adaptable system for tracking and alerting, commonly used to scrape and review numerous operating metrics. This document details how to incorporate Prometheus into a privately hosted setup for Rime.

## Prerequisites
Before proceeding, confirm:
1. You can access a self-hosted instance where the `/metrics` endpoint is exposed (assuming port `8080`).
2. You have permissions to edit the main configuration file, typically `prometheus.yml`.
3. You have permissions to run a Docker container in your environment.

## Running Prometheus

**Step 1: Include a Prometheus Target**

Open `prometheus.yml`. Add a job pointing to your Rime Engine container:

```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 5s  # Scrape metrics every 5 seconds

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "model-rime-tts"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["<instance_ip>:8080"]  # Adjust this
    metrics_path: "/metrics"  # Default path for Prometheus metrics
```

Replace `instance_ip` with the relevant hostname or IP address, then save the file.

**Step 2: Use the following command to pull and run Prometheus in a container:**
```shell
docker run -d \
  --rm \
  -p 9090:9090 \
  -v $(pwd)/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
  prom/prometheus:latest
```
**Step 3: Validate the Setup**

Access the Prometheus UI (commonly at http://localhost:9090), navigate to Status â†’ Targets, and look for the model-rime-tts job. Its status should be UP, confirming Prometheus is successfully collecting metrics.

Exploring Metrics
With Prometheus integrated, you can retrieve metrics through its web interface or API. Many users combine Prometheus with platforms like Grafana to build dashboards and set up alerts.
