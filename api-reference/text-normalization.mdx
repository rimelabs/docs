title: 'Text Normalization'
---

When using Rime's models, most text will be correctly pronounced out-of-the box just by writing naturally. Rime's models understand pronunciation based on context.

However, we do recommend normalizing your text to get consistent and accurate results. 

Text normalization is a crucial step in text-to-speech (TTS) systems, where written text is converted into a form that can be accurately and naturally spoken. Normalization ensures the text is clear, comprehensible, and contextually accurate for speech synthesis.
At Rime we have a unique set of guidelines to help you get the best output. 

To see recommendations for common use cases, such as numbers, dates, and abbreviations, check the pages in the **Recommendations** folder in the menu.
