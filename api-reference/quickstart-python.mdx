This guide shows you how to generate your first audio clip with Rime's text-to-speech (TTS) API and experiment with different voices and speech customizations.

## Prerequisites

To follow this guide, you need:

- **A Rime API token:** Create a free [Rime account](https://app.rime.ai/signup/) and copy your API key from the [API Tokens](https://app.rime.ai/tokens/) page.

- **[Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/) or later:** We use Python to send requests to the Rime API.

## Create your Python script

Create a file called `rime_hello_world.py` and import the required library modules:

```python
import json
import urllib.request
```

Next, we'll create a request to the Rime API.

Set the request headers, specifying the Rime API key that you copied:

```python
RIME_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"

headers = {
    "Accept": "audio/mp3",
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {RIME_API_KEY}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
```

Configure a payload specifying the details of the request:

```python
payload = {
    "text": "Hello! This is Rime speaking.",
    "speaker": "celeste",
    "modelId": "arcana"
}
```

This payload includes the three required parameters:

- `text` adds the text that the model converts to speech.
- `speaker` sets the voice that the agent uses (view your options on our [Voices](/api-reference/voices) page).
- `modelId` specifies which model the agent uses. Use `arcana` for the most realistic voices, or `mistv2` for faster synthesis,

The [Arcana API reference](/api-reference/arcana/streaming-mp3) details the many optional parameters you can add to request payloads.

Now that you've created the headers and payload, make a `POST` request to the Rime API and write the streamed audio response to a file:

```python
data = json.dumps(payload).encode("utf-8")

request = urllib.request.Request(
    "https://users.rime.ai/v1/rime-tts",
    data=data,
    headers=headers,
    method="POST"
)

with urllib.request.urlopen(request) as response:
    with open("output.mp3", "wb") as f:
        while chunk := response.read(4096):
            f.write(chunk)

print("Audio saved to output.mp3")
```

Streaming allows audio playback to begin before generation completes. This enables conversational flow, as the user can start listening to responses before the entire audio clip has been generated.

Although streaming is less important in this example, because we're writing to a file, it's vital when using models in real-time conversations. If this sounds interesting, follow the [LiveKit quickstart](/api-reference/quickstart-livekit/) to create your first conversational agent.

Test the script by running it from the terminal:

```bash
python rime_hello_world.py
```

On a successful run, the terminal displays a confirmation that your audio file has been saved:

```bash
'Audio saved to output.mp3'
```

<audio controls src="/sounds/example-output.mp3"></audio>

## Choose a voice

Rime offers a range of voices with different personalities. To change the voice, update the `speaker` parameter in your request:

```python
payload = {
    "text": "Hello! This is Rime speaking.",
    "speaker": "orion",  # Try different voices here
    "modelId": "arcana"
}
```

Browse all available voices on the [Voices](/api-reference/voices) page.

## Custom pronunciation

The `mistv2` model lets you specify the pronunciation of brand names or uncommon words using Rime's [phonetic alphabet](/api-reference/custom-pronunciation). Add the custom pronunciation in curly brackets and set `phonemizeBetweenBrackets` to `true`:

```python
payload = {
    "text": "Welcome to {r1Ym} labs.",
    "speaker": "peak",
    "modelId": "mistv2",
    "phonemizeBetweenBrackets": True
}
```

Use the [Pronunciation tool](https://rime.ai/dashboard/pronunciation) on the dashboard to generate phonetic strings for any word.

## Next steps

Now that you can generate TTS audio, try following the [LiveKit quickstart guide](/api-reference/quickstart-livekit) to learn how you can set up a real-time conversation with an agent.

To further familiarize yourself with Rime, visit the [Models](/api-reference/models) page to explore the differences between our realistic Arcana model and faster Mistv2 model.
