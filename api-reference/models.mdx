Models are constantly being trained and finetuned based on user and customer feedback. Please check back often as we push changes frequently.

There are currently 3 models that Rime has in production, `arcana`, `mistv2` and `mist`.

**Model v1 was released in April 2022 and has been deprecated.**

**Mist** is Rime’s next generation TTS engine, released April 2023, capable of synthesizing conversational speech. Using the `modelId` parameter for Rime’s TTS endpoints, specifying `mistv2` or `mist`, will allow you to synthesize speech using this newer family of models. As of February 2025, the default value for `modelId` when unspecified is `mist`.

**Mistv2**, released February 2025 has the following features:

* Multi-lingual English + Spanish, plus more languages coming soon
* More realistic speech with natural and contextual nuances
* Advanced pronunciation control
* Ultra-fast on-prem latency of ~70ms, perfect for real-time applications
* More accents, demographics, and speaking styles

**Arcana**, released April 2025, is Rime’s most expressive and lifelike TTS model to date. It pushes the boundary of naturalness and emotional depth in synthesized speech.

* Highly expressive, natural-sounding speech with emotional nuance  
* Fine-grained control over prosody, pacing, and tone  
* Supports a wide range of vocal demographics, including different ages, accents, and cultural backgrounds  
* Enhanced realism for dynamic, conversational, and character-driven use cases  
* Available via `modelId: arcana` through Rime’s API endpoints
