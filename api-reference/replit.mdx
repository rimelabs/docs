[Replit](https://replit.com/) is an AI-powered platform that lets you create and publish apps from a single browser tab. No local setup, no environment headaches. Just describe what you want to build, and Replit's AI agent handles the heavy lifting while you focus on your idea.

Adding Rime's natural, lifelike voices to your Replit apps is refreshingly straightforward. Since Replit supports third-party integrations through its Agent, you simply tell it to use Rime TTS in your prompt, and it wires everything up for you.

## How It Works

Replit's Agent understands external integrations. When you mention Rime TTS and provide the API details, it automatically sets up the code, prompts you for your API key, and stores it securely in [Replit Secrets](https://docs.replit.com/replit-workspace/workspace-features/secrets). Your credentials never touch your frontend code.

Here's how to get started:

**Step 1:** In your Replit prompt, explicitly tell it to use Rime as the TTS provider. Include the API details so the Agent knows exactly what to build:

```
Use Rime TTS
API: POST https://users.rime.ai/v1/rime-tts
Header: Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}
Docs: https://docs.rime.ai/api-reference/arcana/streaming-wav
```

**Step 2:** When Replit asks for the API key, grab yours from [app.rime.ai/tokens](https://app.rime.ai/tokens/) and paste it in. Replit stores it as an encrypted secret and handles the rest.

That's it. Two steps and you've got voice synthesis in your app.

## Example Prompt

Here's an example prompt that shows how everything comes together. Use it to get a feel for how the setup works, then build your own:

```
Build an Instant Voiceover Studio, a single-page app where users paste text, 
pick a voice, and generate professional audio using Rime TTS.

For: Content creators who need quick voiceovers for YouTube, podcasts, and apps.

Design: Rime design language with near-black background (#0D0D0D, #161616), 
orange-to-red gradient accents (#FF9300 to #B10000), grey surfaces (#333, #1A1A1A), 
Inter font. Clean and premium.

Layout (two-column on desktop, stacked on mobile):

Left Panel:
1. Text input area with character count (5000 max)
2. Voice picker with a grid of 8 Arcana flagship voice cards (luna, astra, sirius, 
   estelle, lyra, vespera, walnut, eliphas) with gradient avatars
3. "Generate Voiceover" button following Rime design language
4. Audio controls with play/pause, progress bar, download wav

Right Panel:
5. Three.js particle sphere with a small orb of 500+ particles, centered in the 
   right panel. Slowly rotates when idle with dim orange tint. When audio plays: 
   particles expand outward and glow bright orange (#FF9300) to red (#B10000), 
   pulsing with the voice.

Use Rime TTS
API: POST https://users.rime.ai/v1/rime-tts
Header: Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}
Docs: https://docs.rime.ai/api-reference/arcana/streaming-wav
```

Feel free to tweak the design, swap out voices, or reimagine the app entirely. The essential part is including the Rime TTS instructions with the API endpoint and documentation link. That tells Replit's Agent exactly how to connect your app to Rime.
