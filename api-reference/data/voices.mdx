## Example structure

```json
{
  "v1": [
    "agnes",
    "alexa",
    "alonzo"
    // ...and more...
  ],
  "mist": [
    "amber",
    "ana",
    "antoine"
    // ...and more ...
  ]
}
```

## Explanation

The response object is keyed by the applicable `modelId`. This is the same `modelId` used as an argument to our [TTS APIs](https://rimelabs.mintlify.app/api-reference/endpoint/streaming-pcm).

For example: if calling the TTS API with `modelId` of `"v1"`, `"agnes"` is a valid `speaker`, but `"amber"` wouldn't be.
