Rime is committed to protecting the security and privacy of our users' data. We have implemented a comprehensive security framework to ensure the safety of our users' information. Email us at [info@rime.ai](mailto:info@rime.ai) to request a compliance report.

As of May 2025, we are SOC 2 Type 2 compliant. 

As of February 2024, we are [HIPAA compliant](https://rime.ai/blog/hipaa-compliance). 

As a general practice, we don't collect customer data beyond character count unless requested. If you have concerns, we are happy to sign an MSA or BAA to outline specific terms.

Rime does not use customer data to train our models, unless specifically asked. We also provide an API parameter `trainableUtterance=true` to explicitly allow us to use data for training. If this parameter is not included in an API call, the default is `false` and data will not be used for training.
