title: 'Linguistics and TTS'

Why is solving TTS and synthesizing realistic speech so difficult?

One over-arching reason is the **one-to-many problem** in linguistics: one text string corresponds to infinite possible acoustic realizations! And strings of words can be pronounced differently for special effect.

While Rime remains opinionated on default accoustic realization, and the voices will speak fluently and correctly out-of-the-box, Rime is unique among next-gen TTS offerings in allowing users to customize their output. 

The API also allows you to make extremely low-level adjustments for your particular use case, such as custom pauses and custom pronunciations. To see all the available customization options, check the pages in the **Customization** folder in the menu.
