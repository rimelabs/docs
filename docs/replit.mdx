This guide shows how to add text-to-speech to apps built with [Replit](https://replit.com/), an AI-powered platform where you describe what you want and an AI agent writes the code. Rime is a text-to-speech API that generates natural-sounding voice audio. When your Replit app needs to speak, it sends text to Rime's API and receives audio back.

This approach works well if you want to prototype voice features quickly without writing integration code yourself. Replit's agent handles the API calls, authentication, and audio playback while Rime generates the speech.

## Prerequisites

- A [Replit account](https://replit.com/signup)
- A Rime API key from [app.rime.ai/tokens](https://app.rime.ai/tokens/)

## Create your app

Paste the following prompt into Replit to build a voiceover studio app. It uses the [Arcana](/docs/models#arcana) model's voice library to generate speech. You can modify this prompt to build your own app idea.

```
Build an Instant Voiceover Studio, a single-page app where users paste text,
pick a voice, and generate professional audio using Rime TTS.

For: Content creators who need quick voiceovers for YouTube, podcasts, and apps.

Design: Rime design language with near-black background (#0D0D0D, #161616),
orange-to-red gradient accents (#FF9300 to #B10000), grey surfaces (#333, #1A1A1A),
Inter font. Clean and premium.

Layout (two-column on desktop, stacked on mobile):

Left Panel:
1. Text input area with character count (5000 max)
2. Voice picker with a grid of 16 Arcana voice cards (luna, astra, sirius, estelle,
   lyra, vespera, walnut, eliphas, arcade, atrium, eucalyptus, fern, stucco, transom,
   oculus, moss) with gradient avatars
3. "Generate Voiceover" button following Rime design language
4. Audio controls with play/pause, progress bar, download wav

Right Panel:
5. Three.js particle sphere with a small orb of 500+ particles, centered in the
   right panel. Slowly rotates when idle with dim orange tint. When audio plays:
   particles expand outward and glow bright orange (#FF9300) to red (#B10000),
   pulsing with the voice.

Use Rime TTS
API: POST https://users.rime.ai/v1/rime-tts
Header: Authorization: Bearer RIME_API_KEY (stored in Secrets)
modelId: Arcana
Docs: https://docs.rime.ai/api-reference/arcana/streaming-wav
```

Replit's agent generates code that reads `RIME_API_KEY` from your Secrets and uses it to authenticate with Rime's API.

## Add your API key

Once Replit has created your app, add your Rime API key as a Secret:

1. Press **Cmd+K** (Mac) or **Ctrl+K** (Windows/Linux) to open the command palette
2. Search for **Secrets** and select it
3. Click **New configuration**
4. Enter `RIME_API_KEY` as the key and paste your API key from [app.rime.ai/tokens](https://app.rime.ai/tokens/) as the value

This keeps your key secure so that it never appears in your code or version history
