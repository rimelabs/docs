title: Finding a Voice
---

Rime's TTS functionality exposes both a large set of demographically diverse set of voices to users as well as an increasingly large toolkit for generating voices on the fly.

## Demographic categories

Rime currently has many voices across a number of demographic categories (including Southern, African American, Latina, Midwestern, and LGBT voices) as well as age ranges from young to old.

## Finding a voice

Your [Dashboard](https://rime.ai/dashboard) is a great place to find a voice. By specifying filters, you can find Rime voices that meet your needs.

Using these filters, and using the play button to hear the voices, you've determined `Colby` will be a great voice for your application. You can then use `Colby` as the `speaker` parameter for Rime's TTS API.

**Note**: after you get an account you can use the dashboard to listen to audio samples and find the right voice for your application. To generate audio you will need an active API key accesible and an active subscription.
