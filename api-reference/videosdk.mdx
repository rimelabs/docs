[VideoSDK](https://videosdk.live) provides the infrastructure and developer tools needed to build and scale real-time audio, video, and AI-driven communication. It’s designed for low latency and reliability, enabling applications to stream live media, exchange real-time data, and power interactive AI voice agents without managing complex real-time systems.

Rime’s text-to-speech (TTS) model integrates with VideoSDK to power AI voice agents that speak in real time. Developers can build conversational AI experiences that feel responsive and natural inside calls, meetings, and interactive workflows.

To learn how to use RimeAI TTS with VideoSDK, check out the VideoSDK integration guide in the [VideoSDK's RimeAI TTS documentation](https://docs.videosdk.live/ai_agents/plugins/tts/rime-ai-tts).

Get started quickly with a working example using the [VideoSDK's AI Voice Agent QuickStart](https://github.com/videosdk-community/videosdk-rimeai-tts-demo).
