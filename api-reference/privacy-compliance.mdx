Rime is committed to protecting the security and privacy of our users' data. We have implemented a comprehensive security framework to ensure the safety of our users' information. Email us at [info@rime.ai](mailto:info@rime.ai) to request a compliance report.

As of January 2025, we are undergoing our SOC II audit. 

As of February 2024, we are [HIPPA compliant](https://rime.ai/blog/hipaa-compliance). 

As a general practice, we donâ€™t collect customer data beyond character count unless requested. If you have concerns, we are happy to sign an MSA or BAA to outline specific terms.
