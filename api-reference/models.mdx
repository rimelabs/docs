Models are constantly being trained and finetuned based on user and customer feedback. Please check back often as we push changes frequently.

There are currently two models that Rime has in production, `mistv2` and `mist`.

**Model v1 was released in April 2022 and has been deprecated.**

**Mist** is Rime’s next generation TTS engine, released April 2023, capable of synthesizing conversational speech. Using the `modelId` parameter for Rime’s TTS endpoints, specifying `mistv2` or `mist`, will allow you to synthesize speech using this newer family of models. As of February 2025, the default value for `modelId` when unspecified is `mist`.

**Mistv2**, released February 2025 has the following features:

* Multi-lingual English + Spanish, plus more languages coming soon
* More realistic speech with natural and contextual nuances
* Advanced pronunciation control
* Ultra-fast on-prem latency of ~70ms, perfect for real-time applications
* More accents, demographics, and speaking styles
