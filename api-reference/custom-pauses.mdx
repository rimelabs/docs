title: 'Custom Pauses'
---

By default, Rime will add pauses based on the [punctuation](/api-reference/punctuation) in the sentence. To insert a shorter or longer pause within a sentence, simply inset the length of your desired pause in milliseconds within angle brackets. 

For example: `<750>` inserts a pause of 750 millseconds (or .75 seconds). To hear the difference, compare the following:

|    Audio Clip     |      Sentence             |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
|   <audio controls src="https://rime.ai/sounds/docs/wait_no_pause.wav"></audio>     |    wait, are you actually serious.      |
|   <audio controls src="https://rime.ai/sounds/docs/wait_750.wav"></audio>    |      wait, `<750>` are you actually serious.        |

> **Note**: When making an API request, you must set `pauseBetweenBrackets` to `true`. The request would look like this:

```python Custom Pause Example
{
	"text": "wait, <750> are you actually serious.",
    "speaker": "cove",
    "modelId": "mist",
    "pauseBetweenBrackets": true
}
```
