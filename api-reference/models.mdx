Models are constantly being trained and finetuned based on user and customer feedback. Please check back often as we push changes frequently.

There are currently 3 models that Rime has in production, `arcana`, `mistv2` and `mist`.

## Arcana

**Arcana**, released April 2025, is Rime’s most expressive and lifelike TTS model to date. It pushes the boundary of naturalness and emotional depth in synthesized speech.

* Highly expressive, natural-sounding speech with emotional nuance  
* Fine-grained control over prosody, pacing, and tone  
* Supports a wide range of vocal demographics, including different ages, accents, and cultural backgrounds  
* Enhanced realism for dynamic, conversational, and character-driven use cases  
* Available via `modelId: arcana` through Rime’s API endpoints

## Mist

**Mistv2**, released February 2025 has the following features:

* Multi-lingual English + Spanish, plus more languages coming soon
* More realistic speech with natural and contextual nuances
* Advanced pronunciation control
* Ultra-fast on-prem latency of ~70ms, perfect for real-time applications
* More accents, demographics, and speaking styles

**Mist** is Rime’s next generation TTS engine, released April 2023, capable of synthesizing conversational speech. Using the `modelId` parameter for Rime’s TTS endpoints, specifying `mistv2` or `mist`, will allow you to synthesize speech using this newer family of models. As of February 2025, the default value for `modelId` when unspecified is `mist`.

**Model v1 was released in April 2022 and has been deprecated.**

## Additional Controls

Arcana also supports several additional controls due to its LLM backbone. We recommend leaving these on the default values.

* `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the generated speech.
  * **Low**: Produces more predictable and focused speech.
  * **High**: Introduces variability in prosody and expression, potentially leading to more dynamic speech patterns.
* `repetition_penalty`: Discourages the model from repeating the same sounds.
  * **Low**: May result in repetitive speech patterns.
  * **High**: Encourages variation, leading to more natural-sounding speech and realistic laughter.
* `top_p`: Determines the diversity of choices by limiting the selection to a subset of probable sounds.
  * **Low**: Restricts the model to the most probable sounds, resulting in more monotonic speech.
  * **High**: Allows for a broader range of sound choices, enhancing the naturalness and variability of speech.
