If you’re new to Rime or are have new clients with **unique** words, this is your place to make sure things are perfect out of the gate. 

The **Check Coverage** feature lets you verify whether words are in our pronunciation dictionary, giving you control over your TTS output.

## How it Works

### 1. Upload Your Words
Enter a list of words in the text field.
- Copy and paste content directly


### 2. Check Dictionary Coverage
The system will compare each word against our pronunciation dictionary:
- **Uncovered words** – not yet in the dictionary will appear. 

### 3. Listen to Predicted Pronunciations
For uncovered words, the system generates a predicted pronunciation:
- Often, predictions are accurate and usable immediately.
- You can listen to ensure the pronunciation meets your expectations.

### 4. Request Additions to the Dictionary
If a predicted pronunciation is incorrect:
- Submit a request to add the word to the official dictionary.
- The word appears in the [**Speech QA Dashboard**](https://app.rime.ai/oov/).
- Our linguists will review and add it within one week.

## Benefits
- Ensure correct pronunciation of brand names, technical terms, or uncommon words.
- Gain real-time visibility into dictionary coverage via the dashboard.
- Collaborate with our linguists to improve pronunciation quality.

## Tips
- Check words regularly when working with new or domain-specific content.
- Review predicted pronunciations carefully before submitting requests.
- Track the status of all requests in the [**Speech QA Dashboard**](https://app.rime.ai/oov/).
