We recommend the following inputs to get your desired output.
- [Addresses](#addresses)
- [URLs](#urls)
- [Emails](#emails)

## Addresses

While Rime will typically pronounce state name abbreviations correctly in the context of an address, best practice is to write out the full state name, e.g. "Massachusetts" instead of "MA", to get consistent results. Common street abbreviations, e.g. "Rd." or "St.", will automatically be pronounced correctly.

> **Note**: This functionality depends on the email handles and if those words there are pronounced as-is. For example, `bigjim772roughrider@spikeflowworkout.com` should be broken up into composite parts. You can also use Rime's [custom pronunciations](/api-reference/custom-pronunciations) feature to specify an exact pronunciation or contact us.
