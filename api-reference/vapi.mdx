[VAPI](https://vapi.ai/) is a voice AI platform for developers, empowering you to build, test, and deploy voice agents in minutesâ€”not months.

Rime's text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) model is available via the VAPI API. With VAPI's Rime integration, you can build AI voice applications that that sound as natural as a human conversation.

More information is available in [VAPI's documentation](https://docs.vapi.ai/providers/voice/rimeai).
