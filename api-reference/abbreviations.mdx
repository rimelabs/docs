## Acronyms and Initialisms

Acronyms are pronounced as a single word, for example, NASA is pronounced as "Nasa". Initialisms are pronounced as a series of letters, for example DNA is pronounced as "D N A".

By default Rime will pronounce a series of capital letters as acronyms, i.e. as a single word. However, for many common initialisms, e.g. DNA, ID, USA, FBI, CIA, etc., Rime will automatically pronounce them correctly as a series of letters.

That being said, to ensure that initialisms are pronounced correctly as a series of letters, the best practice is to put a period and space after each letter.

| Desired Output | Input |
| --- | --- |
| Nasa | NASA |
| D N A | DNA |
| D N A | D. N. A. |
| D N A | d. n. a. |
| UPS | u. p. s. |
| GPA | g. p. a. |

**Note:** You can also specify a custom pronunciation for any acronym or initialism, using Rime's [custom pronunciations](/api-reference/custom-pronunciations) feature.
