title: 'Custom Pronunciation'
---

Rime can add new words to the dictionary within about 24 hours, but if you want to set pronunciation yourself, you can input a specific pronunciation within curly brackets. 

Custom pronunciations use Rime's phonetic alphabet (detailed [below](#rimes-phonetic-alphabet)), which is inspired by the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).

For example the word `custom` would be represented as `{k1Ast0xm}`. This even works for made-up words, like `gorbulets`, which would be `{g1orby0ul2Ets}`.

|    Audio Clip     |      Sentence             |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
|   <audio controls src="https://rime.ai/sounds/docs/gorbulets.wav"></audio>     |    actually, `{g1orby0ul2Ets}` is a word i just made up.      |

> **Note**: When making an API request, you must set `phonemizeBetweenBrackets` to `true`. The request would look like this:

```python Custom Pronunciation Example
{
	"text": "actually, {g1orby0ul2Ets} is a word i just made up.",
    "speaker": "peak",
    "modelId": "mist",
    "phonemizeBetweenBrackets": true
}
```

For primary stress, put 1 before the relevant vowel. For example, `comma` would be `{k1am0x}`

For seconadary stress, put 2 in front of the relevant vowel. For example, `auctioneer` would be `{2akS0In1ir}`

All other vowels shoud have a 0 in front of them.
