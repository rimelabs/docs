## When to Use `spell()`

Sometimes you want a letter or number sequence to be spelled out, one unit at a time. At Rime, we make this easy with our `spell()` function.

Using `spell()` natively introduces naturalistic pauses within the sequence. In particular, it groups numbers and letters into groups of three where possible, and two where necessary. For instance, a standard 10-digit telephone number is broken up as follows:

> 4 2 5 `<pause>` 2 5 2 `<pause>` 8 9 `<pause>` 2 9


The same holds for spelling sequences, like long words, being broken up as follows:

> P E N `<pause>` E L O `<pause>` P E


We also introduce helpful pauses when transitioning between numbers and letters in mixed alphanumeric sequences, as follows:

> P R M `<pause>` 4 2 3 `<pause>` G D D `<pause>` M L `<pause>` 2 3 `<pause>` 5 4


This holds for any number, letter, or alphanumeric string. They will be spelled out in full if included in the parentheses of `spell()`. Spell also works with common symbols like @ (at) or - (dash).

Let’s see how this works:

## `spell()` Applied to Words

If I want the sentence to read:  
> “The name is spelled J O N, A T H, A N.”

**Input:**  
`the name is spelled spell(jonathan).`

```json
{
   "speaker": "tibur",
   "modelId": "mistv2",
   "text": "the name is spelled spell(jonathan)."
}
```

## `spell()` Applied to Numbers

For number sequences, if I want the sentence to read:
> “The number is 4 2 5, 2 5 2, 8 9, 2 9.”

**Input:**  
` the number is spell(4252528929).`

```json
{
   "speaker": "tibur",
   "modelId": "mistv2",
   "text": "the number is spell(4252528929)."
}
```

## `spell()` Applied to Alphanumeric Sequences

The same goes for mixed alphanumerics. If I want the sentence to be read:
> the account is r f, 5 4 3, d c, 2

**Input:**  
`the account is spell(rf543dc2).`

```json
{
   "speaker": "tibur",
   "modelId": "mistv2",
   "text": "the account is spell(rf543dc2)."
}
```

## `spell()` Applied to Typographical Symbols

| Symbol | Pronunciation |
|--------|---------------|
| `@` | at |
| `_` | underscore |
| `-` | dash |
| `.` | dot |

Spell also works with common symbols. For example:
> the email address is h e l p, at, r i m e, dot, a i

**Input:**
`the email address is spell(help@rime.ai).`

```json
{
   "speaker": "tibur",
   "modelId": "mistv2",
   "text": "the email address is spell(help@rime.ai)."
}
```
