[SignalWire](https://signalwire.com/) is a modern communications platform offering voice, video, messaging, and AI capabilities. With Rimeâ€™s TTS integration, you can build responsive, lifelike AI voice applications that leverage SignalWire's programmable infrastructure.

Rime's TTS synthesis model is available through the SignalWire API. By integrating Rime with SignalWire, you can develop AI voice applications that deliver natural, real-time interactions.

SignalWire's MovieBot is live and can be reached over the phone at `+1 320 4MOVIES` which uses Rime's `Spore` Mist v2 voice.
