[Together](https://together.ai/) is the leading end-to-end cloud built for training and deploying open-source AI, delivering reliable inference at production scale.

Rime's text-to-speech synthesis models, [Arcana v2](https://www.together.ai/models/arcana-v2) and [Mist v2](https://www.together.ai/models/mist-v2), are available via Together's platform. By deploying Rime’s models on Together AI, developers can now access state-of-the-art speech generation with significant latency savings, without compromising on quality.
