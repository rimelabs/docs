Models are constantly being trained and finetuned based on user and customer feedback. Please check back often as we push changes frequently.

There are currently two models that Rime has in production, **V1** and **Mist**. 

**V1** was released in April 2023. 

**Mist** is Rime's next generation TTS model, capable of synthesizing conversational speech. Using the `modelId` parameter for Rime's TTS endpoints, specifying `mist`, will allow you to synthesize speech using this newer family of models. As of February 2024, the default value for `modelId` when unspecified is `v1`. This is due to change in the future.
